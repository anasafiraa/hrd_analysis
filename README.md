## INTRODUCTION

This project aims to provide a comprehensive insight into HR data, covering factors influencing layoffs, employee distribution, performance, satisfaction, and absenteeism. This data enables the company to make better-informed decisions regarding human resource management.

## Questions to be Answered Through This Analysis
1. What are the Most Common Reasons for Employee Termination?
2. What is the Distribution of Employees Across Different Departments?
3. Is Salary Related to Employment Status (Active vs. Terminated)?
4. Does Employee Engagement Affect Absenteeism?
5. How Does Employee Performance on Marital Status?
6. What are the Biggest Factors Affecting Employee Absenteeism?
7. Do Recruitment Programs from Certain Sources Produce Higher Quality Employees?
8. What is the Performance Difference Between Employees Involved in Special Projects and Those Who Aren’t?

## Analysis
1. - The most frequent reason for termination is "Another position", with a total of 20 terminations. This suggests that many employees are leaving the company because they have found opportunities elsewhere.
   - "Unhappy" is the second most common reason with 14 terminations, indicating potential dissatisfaction among employees with aspects of the work environment, management, or job expectations.
   - "More money" comes in third with 11 terminations, implying that compensation could be a significant factor in employees' decisions to leave the company.

2. - Production with 209 employees indicates the company’s primary focus on production. Monitoring efficiency is essential.
   - IT/IS with 50 employees underscores the importance of technology. Enhancing tech systems could lead to operational gains.
   - Sales has only 31 employees, suggesting room for expansion to drive sales growth.

3. - Lower-paid employees are more likely to resign voluntarily, suggesting a link between salary and retention.
   - High-paid employees terminated for cause indicate that a higher salary doesn't necessarily ensure better performance.

4. - Employees with low engagement tend to have higher absenteeism, suggesting that engagement significantly influences attendance levels.
   - Higher engagement generally leads to lower absenteeism, implying that engagement improvement programs could effectively reduce absenteeism.
5. - Employees who are widowed or divorced tend to have higher performance scores, suggesting they might be more focused on work.
   - Employees who are married or single show slightly lower performance, possibly influenced by family responsibilities or personal life.

6. - Absenteeism does not fully correlate with engagement or satisfaction. Employees with high engagement and satisfaction may still have high absenteeism.
   - Variability in the data suggests that other factors may influence absenteeism, such as workload stress, health, or personal conditions.
7. - Employee Referral is an effective recruitment source for finding high-performing employees.
   - Online-based recruitment sources, while easily accessible, show slightly lower performance, indicating that stricter screening may be necessary.

8. - Participation in special projects appears to positively impact performance, especially if employees are involved in several projects.
   - Low involvement (1 project) or no involvement at all shows lower performance, indicating the importance of active participation in projects to enhance performance.
